# FAQ

> Is this a serious project? Can I run it in production?

No, it is not a serious project, just a hobby project which turned out to be a funny programming exercise. Technically it could be run in production but there's little sense in doing so. You may incur in AWS costs. No guarantee is provided.


> Is this project affiliated with AWS?

No, it is not. It is a project created by [Alvaro Hernandez](https://aht.es), founder of [OnGres](https://ongres.com) and [AWS Data Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/alvaro-hernandez/). There's no affiliation with Amazon AWS and this is not a project nor a service by AWS. "Amazon Web Services", "AWS" and "DynamoDB" are registered trademarks of Amazon Technologies, Inc.


> Are there any limitations compared to DynamoDB?

Yes, see [Limitations](limitations.md).


> What's this software license? Can I run this as-a-Service?

The project is licensed under the [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) Open Source license.

There would be very little sense in running Dyna53 as-a-Service, but it could be done. AGPLv3 license terms ensure that the project will remain Open Source for its users, so if you would run a modified version of it your users would have the right to get a copy of the modified source code.


> How far will be Dyna53 be developed? Are contributions accepted?

Dyna53 is just an excercise and there should be little expectations that it will be developed much further. It is a non-goal to emulate DynamoDB completely.

Contributions are welcomed, though, specially in polishing and testing the existing code, more than adding new features.


> Is there an Easter Egg in the program?

Yes! If you have found it, please open an issue to discuss it :)
